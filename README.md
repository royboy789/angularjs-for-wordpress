AngularJS for WordPress
=========================
  
What is it?
------------
AngularJS for WordPress is a plugin to help anyone easily leverage AngularJS in their theme

V3
---
Now works with __JSON REST API v2__
  
  
Features
---------
__AngularJS for WordPress__ is being built to keep things simple for you. Using AngularJS directives so you don't have to do any JavaScript unless you want to.  
  
__Templating__ is a huge part of WordPress, and to keep the ease of use we have built in a template override system, just copy the 'angularjs-templates' directory from the plugin to your theme directory and you can customize how the directives render!
  
  
Directives
-----------
Directives are HTML elements that act as wrappers for AngularJS code. Functionality including the templates are injected where these elements are found.
  
Example: `<ng-posts></ng-posts>`
  
* ng-posts - used to display a list of posts [ng-post attributes](http://roysivan.com/angularjs-for-wordpress/directives/ng-posts/)
* ng-post - used to display a single post or page [ng-page attributes](http://roysivan.com/angularjs-for-wordpress/directives/ng-post/)
* ng-new-post - used to display a form that creates a post [ng-new-post attributes](http://roysivan.com/angularjs-for-wordpress/directives/ng-new-post/)
  
Shortcodes
------------
Shortcodes are an easy way to add any custom functionality to your post or page without extra coding.
Included in the plugin are shortcodes to input the AngularJS directives, so you don’t have to fuss with the code.  
  
__Available Shortcodes__
* [ng-post id="#"]
* [ng-posts]
